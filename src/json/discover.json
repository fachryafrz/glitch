On easy mode, you deal more damage, take less damage, your status effects have a higher chance to work and the experience penalty on killing enemies at a lower level is reduced. You can also now refight the final boss whenever you want during the expansion, which means that Kagami's Hyper Fang Crush is no longer permanently missable and can be learned by Satori whenever you want.",
